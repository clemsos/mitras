# Mitras : Mining memes

Mitras is a set of scripts used to detect, analyse and visualize memes the Chinese microblog Sina Weibo. You will need the Weiboscope dataset prepared by HKU
It has been developed by Cl√©ment Renaud for his phD research.


## Mining workflow : 
The different workflows used in this research are documented in iPython notebook in the 
```/doc``` folder.

* ```es_*``` : plain-text search and mining with ElasticSearch and Kibana
* ```hashtags_*``` : build and analyze a corpus of all hashtags in the datasets
* ```pm_*``` : meme detection clustering algorithm using protomemes [(Ferrara, 2013)](http://www.emilio.ferrara.name/2013/08/01/clustering-memes-in-social-media/)

For visualisation, we use Matplotlib, d3js, Networkx and Gephi.

## Data : the Weiboscope  corpus 
To create this project we will use the data provided by the project Weiboscope from HKU University, JMSC - [link](http://147.8.142.179/datazip/). The dataset contains sample data from 52 weeks of 2012 from more than 350,000 Chinese microbloggers who have more than 1,000 followers (Fu, Chan, Chau, 2013 ; Fu, Chau, 2013).

Note : this data has been anonymized

# Detect memes

We aim at detecting memes from a social media dataset

In a recent paper, E. Ferrara from Indiana U proposes a meme clustering algorithm based on the concept of protomeme [1]. We propose here a continuation and a slightly different implementation

### The concept of protomemes
**Protomeme** is an abbreviation of "prototype meme". It refers to a meme which is under construction. The term "protomeme" was first used by Liane Gabora in 1997 [2]
